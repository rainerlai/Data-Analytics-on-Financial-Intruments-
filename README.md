Creation of an optimised portfolio of ETFs and weighing between High ESG vs Low ESG on performance 

Executive Summary
With an ever-increasing investor interest on Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) performance and its impact on risk and returns decisions, this project aims to demonstrate and analyse between two portfolios, each composed of stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) of relative high and low ESG scores. We compared three stocks and ETFs from comparable industries and determine whether a high ESG risky portfolio would outperform low ESG risky portfolio. To ensure comparability, we chose the stocks listed on the United States’ major exchanges. First, we looked at a 2-assets optimiser comprising ESG stocks and ETFs, together with a US treasury bond as a risk-free asset. For the 3-assets optimiser, we added the S&P 500 Market Index ETF to the 2-assets optimiser for further portfolio diversification. We then completed the portfolio by pairing these optimal weights with the respective stocks and ETFs and determine the best optimal portfolio for various risk aversion levels of investors. Our research showed us that low ESG risky portfolio still performs better in the short run but with sustainability being the next revolution, we expect the high ESG risky portfolio to generate better returns in the long run. 

Introduction
In recent years, Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) movement has picked up speed and more companies are increasingly ESG aware. It further accelerated due to the worldwide disruptions since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak. The world’s market saw record inflows of ESG funds since 2020 (Figure 1). We wanted to examine if high ESG stocks indeed outperformed low ESG stocks given the increased interest in ESG, the theoretical advantages that comes with being more sustainable and the significant fund inflows during the market turmoil.  We also wanted to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the market performance  as it is touted as a once-in-a-lifetime event.

We referred to Corporate Knights’ 2021 Index of world’s most sustainable corporations and MSCI ESG ratings to shortlist our United States listed stock selection for security allocation. Empirical evidence has shown us that our research should not depend on a single ESG rating as there is a lack of common rating methodology. Hence, we have also included Refinitiv ESG score as a reference. We ensured that the shortlisted companies had consistent results in both ESG ratings, e.g. if it is rated as a “Leader” in MSCI, it should also be in the top percentile in Refinitiv.

Our passive investment strategy, with a time horizon of five years, is based on the outlook of a recovering economy post pandemic where Industry 4.0 is vitalising the way we operate. To ensure diversification, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) are included. A Volatility Index (VIX) ETF is also included in the portfolio to hedge against the market (i.e. profit from increases in the expected volatility of the S&P 500, as it has historically been negatively correlated to S&P 500 returns).
